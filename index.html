Welcome to my website, styled like an Emacs buffer!

** Features

- Pure black background with white text
- iA Writer Mono S font (same as my Emacs)
- Clean interface with no visible navigation
- M-x command system for navigation
- Emacs-inspired mode line

** Navigation

Press M-x (Alt+x or Option+x on Mac) to open the command palette.
Then type a command:

  - switch-buffer    : Choose a buffer to switch to
  - list-buffers     : See all available buffers
  - home             : Go to home buffer
  - about            : Go to about buffer
  - projects         : Go to projects buffer
  - contact          : Go to contact buffer
  - scratch          : Go to scratch buffer

Just start typing and it will autocomplete!

** Technical Details

This website uses:
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- No frameworks or dependencies
- Emacs modus-vivendi color scheme
- Your actual Emacs font: iA Writer Mono S
- M-x style command palette

Try it now: Press M-x and type "about"
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="buffer" id="about">
            <div class="buffer-content">
;; About buffer
;;
;; Information about this Emacs-style site
;; Press M-x to navigate (Alt+x or Option+x)

* About

This is an experimental website designed to look and feel like
an Emacs text editor.

** Philosophy

Emacs is not just a text editor, it's a way of life. This website
brings the Emacs aesthetic to the web:

- Minimalist black and white color scheme
- Monospace font for maximum readability
- M-x command-based navigation
- Focus on content over decoration
- No visible chrome or navigation bars

** Design Principles

1. Content First: No distractions, pure information
2. Keyboard-Friendly: Everything accessible via M-x
3. Emacs Aesthetics: Looks like home for Emacs users
4. Fast Loading: No heavy JavaScript frameworks
5. Clean Interface: No visible links or navigation

** Tech Stack

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling (Modus Vivendi theme)
- Vanilla JavaScript for M-x command system
- iA Writer Mono S font (same as your Emacs)

** Commands

Press M-x and try these commands:
  - home          : Return to home page
  - projects      : View projects
  - contact       : Contact information
  - scratch       : Scratch buffer
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="buffer" id="projects">
            <div class="buffer-content">
;; Projects buffer
;;
;; A list of projects in org-mode style
;; Press M-x for navigation commands

;; This buffer is for text that is not saved, and for Lisp evaluation.
;; To create a file, visit it with M-x find-file and enter text in its buffer.

(message "Hello from the scratch buffer!")

;; You can't actually evaluate Lisp here (it's just a website)

;; Or just use it for temporary notes:

* Random Thoughts

- Emacs is amazing
- Web design should be more like Emacs
- Monospace fonts are beautiful
- Less is more
- M-x is the best interface paradigm ever invented

** TODO Items

- [ ] Add more content to website
- [ ] Implement syntax highlighting
- [ ] Add search functionality (M-x search?)
- [ ] Make it fully responsive
- [ ] Add more Emacs commands

** Scratch Space

Write anything here...

** Emacs Commands That Would Be Cool on the Web

1. C-x C-s : Auto-save to localStorage
2. C-x b   : Quick buffer switching
3. C-s     : Incremental search
4. C-x C-c : Actually quit the browser (just kidding!)

** Why M-x Is Perfect

M-x allows you to:
- Access everything without memorizing shortcuts
- Discover features through autocomplete
- Keep the interface clean
- Stay focused on content
- Feel like a wizard
